# WordZapper

I, Ageu Felipe Nunes Moraes, recreated the WordZapper game for academic purposes, inspired by the classic Atari game. This game features unique gameplay where players must form words in the correct order while dodging enemies and managing limited time.

## Features

- **Word Formation:** Players must assemble the words that appear on the screen in the correct order after they disappear.
- **Limited Time:** The game has a constantly decreasing timer. Each correctly assembled letter adds 5 seconds to the remaining time.
- **Dodging Challenge:** Enemies appear from the sides of the screen, and players must dodge them to avoid losing time **literally**.
- **Intuitive Controls:** Use the arrow keys to move the player and the spacebar to shoot.
- **Game Over:** The game ends when the timer reaches zero. Try to assemble as many words as possible before that.
